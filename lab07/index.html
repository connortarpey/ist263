        <img src="../images/connortarpeybanner.png" alt="banner">

        <p>My name is Connor Tarpey and I am currently a Information Management & Technology Major with a concentration in Information Security at Syracuse University. My interest and pursuits in this field have been to examine <strong>emerging technologies</strong>. I have had several opportunities to gain hands-on experience, including an internship at Sidearm Sports as a Data Curator, where I was responsible for importing and analyzing HTML data to aid in integrating new websites. Additionally, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Florence, Italy where I interned in an information security role. I also helped co-found the Blockchain Cuse club, which aims to educate and connect students interested in Web3.0 and emerging technologies. In addition to my interests in technology, I am also skilled in the Adobe Suite and have a vast graphic/web design background. I am currently working at Acrisure as an IT intern.</p>
