    </head>

    <body>
        My name is Connor Tarpey and I am currently a Information Management & Technology Major with a concentration in Information Security at Syracuse University. My interests and pursuits in this field have been to examine emerging technologies. I have had several opportunities to gain hands-on experience, including an internship at Sidearm Sports as a Data Curator, where I was responsible for importing and analyzing HTML data to aid in integrating new websites. Additionally, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Florence, Italy where I interned in an information security role. I also helped co-found the Blockchain Cuse club, which aims to educate and connect students interested in Web3.0 and emerging technologies. In addition to my interests in technology, I am also skilled in the Adobe Suite and have a vast graphic/web design background.
        Outside of work, I am an avid football fan and enjoy snowboarding. In my free time, I like to relax by watching the NFL, or my favorite TV show, Family Guy. Overall, I am a dedicated and hardworking individual who is passionate about technology. I am constantly seeking new opportunities to learn and grow in this field.
